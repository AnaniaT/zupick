The fab button on the core page has a badge and its UI will be ruined for 3 digit numbers. It is unrealistic for these numbers to come up, however it is worth mentioning.

Something must be done for long name of the food items, the name should not overflow and ruin the UI but should be optimized with an ellipsis.
